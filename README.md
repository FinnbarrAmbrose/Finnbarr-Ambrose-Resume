# Resume Website Project

## Project Overview

This project is a personal resume website designed to showcase my CV information and demonstrate my ability to create and program websites. It provides potential employers, collaborators, and clients with an interactive and visually appealing way to view my professional details, skills, and contact information. The site also highlights my technical skills, including using APIs, Bootstrap, and other web development tools.

## Purpose

The website serves two primary purposes:

1. To act as an online CV that potential employers and collaborators can easily access.
2. To demonstrate my technical skills as a Full Stack Developer by incorporating interactive features and modern web development practices.

## Features

- **Google Maps Integration**: Displays a map with custom markers and clustering functionality.
- **GitHub API Integration**: Fetches and displays GitHub user data and repositories dynamically.
- **Contact Form**: Utilizes EmailJS for seamless email functionality.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Custom icons for navigation and social media links.
- **Bootstrap Framework**: Ensures responsive design and easy layout structuring.
- **Custom Loader**: Displays a loader animation while GitHub API data is being fetched.
- **Work History Timeline**: A visually appealing timeline of my professional experience.
- **Skills Section**: Progress bars showcasing proficiency in various technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 and CSS3**: For structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content.
- **Bootstrap 4**: For responsive layout and design.
- **jQuery**: For easier DOM manipulation and API integration.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons.
- **Google Maps API**: To add an interactive map.
- **EmailJS**: For contact form functionality.

## APIs Used

- **Google Maps API**: Used to display a customizable map with markers and clustering.
- **GitHub API**: Fetches user and repository data dynamically.
- **EmailJS**: Provides the backend for the contact form to send emails directly to my inbox.

## Project Setup

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install and configure the following versions:
   - **Bootstrap 4.2.1** (via CDN)
   - **Font Awesome 4.7.0** (via CDN)
   - **Hover.css 2.1.1** (via CDN)
   - **jQuery 3.2.1** (via CDN)
3. Obtain API keys for:
   - **Google Maps API**
   - **EmailJS** (Create an account and replace the public key and template ID with your own in the `sendMail` function).

## Challenges and Learning

This project was my first attempt at using Bootstrap, and it helped me understand how to structure responsive layouts efficiently. The primary challenge was learning to integrate APIs and frameworks while following the Code Institute's Full Stack Development course. I overcame these challenges by carefully following instructional videos and experimenting with the code.

## Future Enhancements

- **Python Integration**: Refactor the site to use templates for headers and footers.
- **JSON Content Management**: Load content dynamically through a JSON file to improve performance.
- **Back-End Development**: Add back-end functionality for smoother data management.
- **Custom Design**: Replace placeholder images and refine the design to make it more unique.
- **Screenshots**: Add screenshots of the project to showcase its features visually.

## Target Audience

- Potential employers
- Collaborators and clients
- Anyone interested in my technical and creative work

## Testing

I plan to test the site thoroughly as I add features. Testing will include:

1. Functional Testing: Verifying that all features work as expected.
2. Responsive Testing: Ensuring the site adapts well to various devices and screen sizes.
3. Browser Compatibility: Testing across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
4. API Testing: Confirming that APIs return correct data and handle errors gracefully.

I will document future testing in a table format:

| Feature      | Expected Result           | Actual Result                  | Status |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------ |
| Google Maps  | Map displays with markers | Map and markers load correctly | Pass   |
| Contact Form | Sends email to my inbox   | Email received successfully    | Pass   |
